This is a "fork" of XSBench

"Fork" is in quotes because "fork" is a github idea, and not a core git functionality

After cloning this library, run the command

  git remote add upstream http://https://github.com/ANL-CESAR/XSBench.git


This will add the main library as an additional remote for the project. Changes from 
the core project can then be merged into this fork using the command

  git pull upstream master
